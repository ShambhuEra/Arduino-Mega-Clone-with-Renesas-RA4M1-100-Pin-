# Arduino-Mega-Clone-with-Renesas-RA4M1-100-Pin-
This repository contains firmware which has to be reviewed by git users for a custom Arduino Mega-compatible board based on the Renesas RA4M1 (R7FA4M1AB3CFM#AA0) microcontroller.
I am trying to create a clone for my project which has the pin configuration just like the Original Arduino Mega 2560 but has the power of Arduino Minima Rev 4. I am using Renesas RA4M1 (R7FA4M1AB3CFM#AA0) microcontroller for my clone. 
Review the firmwire/core files i made by reference of original Arduino Core for renesas, if needed suggest the corrections
